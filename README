### BUILD EXAMPLE FOR BIKAYA PROJECT (OPERATING SYSTEMS) 2019/2020 @UNIBO USING SCONS ###

This build system uses SCONS 3.1.2, for additional information https://scons.org/
You need Python 2.7 or 3.x. With pip installer use 'pip install scons' for scons installation or download it at their website above.

Add all source files and headers in local directory and modify the .c files list as shown in the example.
Build using 'scons TARGET' where TARGET is either uarm or umps / umps2. Clean TARGET files using 'scons TARGET -c'.
Cleaning is not necessary when changing build target.
The build heavily depends on the presence of uarm_include and umps_include local directories as they contain build files and SConscript files.
The SConstruct file as it is does not support additional directories automatically, please refer to SCons documentation for changes.
